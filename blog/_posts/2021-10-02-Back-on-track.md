Life has been quite busy these last few months, so I haven't been able to continue with the development of this website.

Things have changes, though. It seems like I might be able to keep learning HTML, CSS and markdown after all.

Of course, these aren't my only current projects. I also have college. I also want to start developing maps for S&Box. I will make posts in this site about my map-making endeavours.

I have updated (rewrited, really) the CSS of the site. I have also improved the accesibility from mobile devices. I'm far from satisfied with the current design of it all, but it's getting better. I'll keep on changing things.

I have also added a dark theme.
